\subsection{Banks}
There are a finite number $ N $ of infinitely lived banks who discount the future at rate $ \beta $. At the beginning of each period, bank $ i $ is described by two scalars, working capital and risky assets, which we denote by $ (D_{i,t},B_{i,t}) $. Banks partition working capital into a liquid form, ``money'', $ M_{i,t} $ which bear no returns, or, an illiquid form, ``loans'', $ L_{i,t} $ which bear constant interest $ 1 + r $. There are sub-periods in each $ t $. We assume that all information is public. As variables change from period to period, we use $ t' $ to denote the first instance where a variable changes within period, $ t'' $ to denote the same variable after the second change, and so on.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Wealth shock.} All banks experience IID shock $ w_{i,t} $ to $ D_{i,t} $. 
\[ D_{i,t'} = D_{i,t} + w_{i,t} \]
\item \textbf{Frictional markets.} One randomly selected bank is allowed to post one TIOLI fixed-for-floating offer. Denote the change in a bank's working capital position from trade by $ \Delta^D_{i,t} $ and the change in the risky asset position by $ \Delta^B_{i,t} $.
\[ D_{i,t''} = D_{i,t'} +  \Delta^D_{i,t} \]
\[ B_{i,t'}  = B_{i,t} +  \Delta^B_{i,t} \]
\item \textbf{Reallocation.} Banks decide on $ M_{i,t} $ and $ L_{i,t} $ such that 
\[ M_{i,t} + L_{i,t} = D_{i,t''}. \]
\item \textbf{Risky returns.} With probability $ \lambda $ which is independent across firms, risky assets post returns $ r^B_{i,t} $ which may be negative. If risky returns are realized, a banks change in its money holdings is 
\[ \Delta^M_{i,t} = M_{i,t} + r^B_{i,t}B_{i,t'}. \] 
\[ M_{i,t'} = \Delta^M_{i,t} + M_{i,t} \] 
If $ M_{i,t'} < 0 $ a kitten dies.
\item \textbf{Risk-free return.} \[ L_{i,t'} = (1+r)L_{i,t} \]
\item \textbf{Competitive market.} All banks participate in a competitive fixed-for-floating market.
\[ q_tB_{i,t+1} + D_{i,t+1} = q_{t}B_{i,t'} + L_{i,t'} + M_{i,t'} \]
\end{enumerate}
